# network_extraction_reliability
 reliability check for extracting network data from text sources based on Divi√°k, T., & Lord, N. (2023). From text to ties: Extraction of corruption network data from deferred prosecution agreements. Data & Policy, 5, e4. doi:10.1017/dap.2022.41
NOTE: the code in relCheckFin.R assumes the same ordering of nodes in order to assess the realibility of the extracted network. If the nodes are NOT in the same order in both matrices, they can either be re-arranged in UCINET or using the code in the other script in this repository: relCheckELtoMats.R (using the graph4lg package)
